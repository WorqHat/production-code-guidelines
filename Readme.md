> Developing a new project often feels like a breath of fresh air, akin to frolicking in a lush, green field. However, maintaining that same project can sometimes feel like navigating a dark, twisted labyrinth. This is a reality many developers face, and it's why we've compiled this comprehensive guide.

> At WorqHat, we've discovered, written, and gathered a set of guidelines that have proven to be effective for most of our JavaScript projects. These guidelines are not set in stone; they are a living document, open to revisions and improvements. If you have a best practice to share, or believe that one of our guidelines should be reconsidered, we welcome your input.

> This guide encapsulates our collective wisdom and experience, which we share with our team members when building production-level code. It covers a wide range of topics, from GitHub practices, JavaScript conventions, CSS-in-JS techniques, to deployment processes.

> Our aim is to equip you with the knowledge and tools you need to build and maintain robust, scalable, and efficient applications. We hope this guide serves as a valuable resource in your development journey.
